      <h2><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/usgs/earthquake-database">Earthquake Dataset</a></h2>
      <p>This earthquake dataset can be used as a force diagram. Each earthquake would
        be made as a circle on the graph and would have its relevant data loaded into
        the circle. Then, the edges can be decided by a certain attribute of the
        previous earthquake to the next one. For example, you could use the depth as
        the edge and connect each earthquake by their depth.

      <h2><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/karangadiya/fifa19">Fifa Players Dataset</a></h2>
      <p>You could use the Fifa 19 players as a force diagram. Each player in the
        dataset would be a circle and would have their data loaded in, making them a
        node. Then, you can make the edges of the nodes represent the difference
        between age.

      <h2><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/noriuk/us-education-datasets-unification-project">U.S. Students Dataset</a></h2>
      <p>You can use the U.S. education dataset to represent a force diagram. Each
        value in the dataset could be a circle with its data loaded into it. Then,
        you have many options to choose what the edges will represent because there
        are many differing factors. You could fill in the color of the circle by state,
        or any other attribute you need to use in the dataset. Then, you could connect
        the circles by their total revenue, year, or any other attribute in the circle.
